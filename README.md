Genetic algorithm for shortest path

It is a sample trying for GA in seraching shortest path.
Actually,my case has no high accuracy to find the shortest path.Sometimes it gives a wrong answer.
In the crossing part,I use PMX(PaniallyMappedcrossover,PMx) operator,but some papers figure out that it is not a good way and 
next time I will try IX operator.
 
In data.txt,It including some information.The first number is the sum of the node,and then it is a adjacency matrix."999" means
unreachable.
Finally,it is a undirected graph.
